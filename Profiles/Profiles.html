					<h1>Interest in IT</h1>
				</div>

				<div class="sectionContent">
					<p>I have been interested in Information Technology (IT) since a young age, and my interest has evolved over time as the technology itself has evolved.  Simply put, the entertainment aspect of IT is what got me hooked initially. This started with playing video games on the NES, followed by an upgrade to SNES. My interest then moved on to  PCs as they started to become more common at home, along with the initial internet setup  which included a dial-up modem. I  would not say I had a “light bulb” moment where I thought to myself “IT is great”, but rather I just simply grew up using the technology and learned to enjoy it along the way.  There were a few moments I remember that definitely cemented my interest in IT,  such as when I built my first PC,  attended my first LAN party and had my first introduction to networking. </p>
					<p>I have been surrounded by IT most of my adult life, as my job in the Navy is primarily IT-focused. The Navy has provided me with many training opportunities in IT, however these skills count for little when it comes to recognition in the civilian world. I have worked in 1-3 service desk roles, as well as in server management, various networking technologies, system administration and system virtualisation. I have also been in supervisory- and management-level positions within those roles, due to the amount of time I have spent in them. </p>
					<p>My choice to attend RMIT was because this particular course is available through Open Universities Australia (OUA), and I want to do a degree in IT both remotely and part-time. OUA did offer the degree at another institution, but the units that RMIT offer are better suited to what I want to study.</p>
					<p>During my study I expect to learn the fundamentals of what IT is, and how it is applied in industry today. Having a military background, we often do things differently to what is done in industry, so it will be good to get a wide picture of what IT is like outside of the military. Additionally,  it will be good to be able to see what technologies/processes are used in IT that I  might be unaware of simply due to the fact of being in the military, as there are many applications and technologies which are not relevant to us in the defence force.</p>

					<h2>Myers Briggs Type Indicator</h2>

					<h3>Test Results</h3>
					<p>After completing the 16 personalities test, it turns out I am a bit like Captain America by having the “Defender” personality. As a Defender, we are often introverted and can be quite distant, however that is only until we get to know someone.. After that point we tend to take on our namesake as a Defender, often sacrificing our own time to assist our friends and family that are in need.  For me, this test just cements my understanding of who I am. I am quite introverted until I get to know someone, and once I do know them I normally try and help them whenever I can. </p>

					<h3>Team Behaviour</h3>
					<p>When working in a new team environment I am often in the background keeping to myself, but once tasks are assigned I always get it done. There is the chance I will overwhelm myself with tasks and will not ask for assistance. However, this is not the case once the team is no longer new and I understand the tasks/objective, as I tend to be a patient and supporting team member who assists  new members as required to make them comfortable. Having this knowledge about my behaviour will influence how I interact with the team, by trying not to be  so shy, and to resist the urge to take on too much work which would otherwise be to my own detriment.</p>

					<h3>Forming a Team</h3>
					<p>I generally do not worry about forming a new team, as I intermingle with anyone and everyone quite easily. While to me this might seem easy enough, there is the potential that I do not realise that I am being shy or introverted. Something I have realised throughout my life is that I need  to be cognisant of who the strong people are in the team, so as not to be taken advantage of. Strong personalities may see the quiet/shy person as someone they can take advantage of in order to offload some of their work on to them. Having the ability to recognise this helps not only myself, but also to stop this from happening to others, and ensuring that the workload is shared equally amongst everyone.</p>

					<h2>Learning Styles</h2>

					<img src="Files/Learning.jpg" alt="Learning Style Results"/>

					<h3>Test Results</h3>
					<p>After conducting a few learning style tests, it has become apparent that I am classified as a ‘Visual’ Learner. This is quite surprising as I had thought I was a kinaesthetic learner, but after reading various characteristics of what a Visual learner is, it actually does align with how I prefer to learn. Basically, I prefer to see and read things rather than  listen to a teacher speak, for example.</p>

					<h3>Team Behaviour</h3>
					<p>When working in a team, understanding how I learn will influence my behaviour by encouraging me to discuss ideas or plans using visual methods, rather than just chatting through Skype or Discord for example. However, given  how teams generally work when using tools like Skype or Discord, I will  need the people who may be verbally describing something  to be very detailed in their description, so that I can visualise what they are saying such that I have  a good idea of what they mean.</p>

					<h3>Forming a Team</h3>
					<p>When forming a new team, the biggest challenge  is making sure that everyone is on the same page. This  will require us to cater to all three  styles of learning. Having a visual medium will be critical for the visual learners, and having something physical. For example, having the ability to physically type out some code will assist with  kinaesthetic learning. Auditory learners will want to discuss the material in great detail, so having components of all these three  things will help when forming a team. </p>

					<h2>Aptitude Test</h2>

					<img src="Files/aptitude.jpg" alt="Aptitude Test Results"/>

					<h3>Test Results</h3>
					<p>With the results above it is quite apparent that I am good with numerical tasks compared to that of verbal or word-based tasks. My word relationship score of zero means  that I do not,   or am less likely to, think methodically and see any relationships between words. To me I find this a bit confronting, as I am  often told that I am very methodical in the way that I do things. I am not surprised by the high score in  numerical logic and numerical word problems, as I am a logical person in general.</p>

					<h3>Team Behaviour</h3>
					<p>While I do not  think that this test is too important when it comes to my behaviour in a team, mainly because I think these types of tests are more suited to employers who are looking for the right person for a specific job. Additionally,  these tests do not  really have much to do with a person's behaviour when in a team environment. Therefore,  using these types of tests to make a decision about  how one  should/would form a team would be quite a poor choice. </p>

				<h1>Project Idea</h1>
			</div>

			<div class="sectionContent">
				<article>
					<h2>Overview</h2>
					<p>My project idea is to use  IT to increase the amount of solar radiation that can be generated by  a solar panel array. This can be used either as a business capability, by being a selling point due to the fact that the  solar panel array will generate more electricity than the competition, or, , it can be used by a homeowner wanting to get the most out of their existing  solar panels. Essentially it will involve using a small computer which will decide where the best part of the sky is to point the  solar array for maximum sun exposure, which will  in turn generate the most electricity it possibly can.</p>

					<h2>Motivation</h2>
					<p>My motivation for this project is due to the fact that  I consider  renewable energy production to be important and something that we as a society should be striving for. The move away from fossil fuels and toward renewable energy needs to be hastened if we are going to avoid a climate change disaster. We need  to do the best that we can  to harness as much solar energy as possible, and we can start by using solar tracking solar arrays. According to a study by Hafez et al. (2018) using a solar tracking system can increase solar generation by  8-50%, based on many factors such as weather, location and tracking type to name just a few.</p>

					<h2>Description</h2>
					<p>This project has a one main system which controls and drives a number of subsystems. The main system will be a small form factor computer which will be responsible for doing all the computing for the two subsystems. It will use a Raspberry Pi to do all the processing required and handle hosting features, as well as use  inputs from wind and light sensors as well as GPS receiver.</p>

					<p>The first subsystem, which is by far the most important part, is the solar tracking system. The system will be able to do this by itself using its various inputs. In this subsystem there will be two  main components; the first relates to  tracking the Sun’s  path.  It will do this initially by using the unit’s GPS position and then inputting that value into the solar positioning algorithm. By using this method it will give an approximate location of where the Sun  will be located in relation to the unit and drive the solar array into position. Once in position, the unit will then do fine-tuning by using an onboard light sensor, which will input values  from the  UV and infrared  spectrum. The  computer will use these values to fine tune the array for maximum energy harvesting.</p>

					<p>The second component relates to  driving the solar array into position. It will do this using the data from the first component to drive various electric motors for linear actuators combined with a motor controller to move the array into position. There are two options available for the array: using either a single axis or a dual axis tracking array. Research(1) has shown that in the Australian environment, using a single axis array will potentially increase your solar harvesting capability by roughly 20%. However, using a  dual axis array will potentially provide an additional 5-10%. Having  two options available enables  customers to pick which system is best for them.</p>

					<p>The second component of the main system is the website hosting services that the Raspberry Pi will provide. The website will provide the system owner with the ability  to control and monitor their solar array. It will hopefully provide a plug into their solar inverter and batteries (if they have them) to display their current kWh generation as well as the battery charge levels and total power produced versus  actual power drawn.</p>

					<p>Once the array is built, the system will only need a small amount of time to set up, which simply involves  connecting it to an internet source via wifi, cellular  or cabled connection if available, and then an initial configuration. Once done, the system will be “set and forget” once it is up and running, and will require next to no maintenance save for the solar array tracking mechanics.</p>

					<p>Future works will hopefully be to fully integrate all aspects of your home/business solar system into the website, and to incorporate a mobile application for ease of use wherever you are in the world. </p>

					<h2>Tools and Technology</h2>
					<p>The tools and technologies required to get the project up and running are vast, covering both IT and electrical engineering. Below is a list of software and hardware that will be required to bring this project idea into the world:</p>
					<p>Hardware</p>
					<ul class="skills">
						<li>Raspberry Pi (Pi v3b minimum, External Case, 16gb Micro SD Card) </li>
						<li>Motor Controller</li>
						<li>Solar Array (Panels, Wiring, Electric motors/ linear actuators and metal structure)</li>
						<li>Solar System (Inverter, batteries and regulator)</li>
						<li>Light sensor</li>
						<li>GPS antenna </li>
					</ul>
					<p>Software</p>
					<ul class="skills">
						<li>Raspbian OS</li>
						<li>Python - To code the program to control the electric motors/linear actuators</li>
						<li>Apache - As the web server hosting HTML/Java based website</li>
					</ul>

					<h2>Skills Required</h2>
					<p>To get this project up and running will require a range of skill sets. The three main skills will be:</p>
					<ol class="numbers">
						<li>Website Developer - This person will be responsible for creating and managing the website using primarily Java which will integrate with the solar tracking software. They will also be responsible for the setup and maintaining the Apache web server.</li>
						<li>Program Developer - Will create the solar  tracking software using Python, which will take input from the various sensors to figure out where to drive the array to get maximum exposure from the sun.</li>
						<li>Electrical Engineer - This person will be responsible for taking the outputs of the solar tracking program and turning them into electrical instructions to drive the motors/linear actuators.</p>
					</ol>
					<p>These three  core positions will be easily fill-able as they only require  basic level skills, as the requirements are not too complex. Furthermore, the hardware is commercially and readily available which will  help the project as nothing is design specific.</p>
					<p>Once the concept is proven, we would look to acquire someone in marketing and sales with a view to increase  sales and expand the business. Also, we will need to get a mobile app developer onboard to help with the mobile application. However, this is dependent on whether the project is successful.</p>

					<h2>Outcome</h2>
					<p>Should the project be successful, the amount of electricity that can be harnessed from solar arrays will be greatly enhanced, and we will be moving in the right direction towards our zero global emissions target. </p>
